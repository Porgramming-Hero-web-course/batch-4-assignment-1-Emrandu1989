The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
TypeScript's type system provides powerful tools to enhance code safety and expressiveness, two of which are union types and intersection types. These types allow developers to create more flexible and reusable code while ensuring strong type-checking.

Union Types (|)
Union types allow a variable to hold multiple types. This is useful when you want to allow a variable to be one of several types. For example, if you want a variable that can either be a string or a number, you can define it as follows:


let value: string | number;
value = "Hello"; // OK
value = 42; // OK
Union types are commonly used when a function can accept different types of arguments, such as when a function can handle either a string or a number.

Intersection Types (&)
Intersection types combine multiple types into one. This is useful when you want a value to satisfy multiple type constraints simultaneously. For example, if you want a variable that is both a Person and a Worker, you can define an intersection type like this:


interface Person {
  name: string;
}

interface Worker {
  job: string;
}

type WorkerPerson = Person & Worker;

const worker: WorkerPerson = { name: "Alice", job: "Developer" };
Intersection types are great when you want to combine features of multiple types into a single object.

Conclusion
Both union types and intersection types empower developers to write more flexible and maintainable code. Union types allow variables to hold different types, while intersection types combine features of multiple types. These features make TypeScript a powerful tool for handling complex data structures and building robust applications.
